I am a software developer that enjoys blogging for fun.  It's hard to justify spending a ton of money in this economy for a hobby blog.

I also love tacos not just eating them, but making them.

I wanted to start a blog that I could truly say is mine, while keeping it as free as possible.  This blog is my story to blog freely about code and tacos.
