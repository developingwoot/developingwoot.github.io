I am an amateur software developer that enjoys blogging for fun. It's hard to justify spending a ton of money for a hobby blog.

I also love tacos not just eating them, but making them.

I wanted to start a blog that I could truly say is mine, while keeping it as free as possible. This blog is my story to blog freely about code and tacos.
